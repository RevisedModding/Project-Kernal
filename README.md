driver is indeed public/open source (anyone can use it) made by null, so plz dont think some shitty CW trainer really made this...
glow was made by @AdrianVPL, any p2c use this or skidded version's of it. myself put this together too provide a simple cheat people can use while it stays UD
if your any good with function hooking in kernel you could possibly make this a better driver.

my discord if you have issue :  ᴛʀᴀᴠᴇꜱᴛʏ#3435
if your on 2004 download the supported kdmapper.
